# Student Dropbox Extension v1.0

This extension adds a button to the review page.The button opens the student's dropbox folder,
speeding up the process of needing to go to dropbox, and searching for the student's folder.


## Installation

```bash
1. Download the repo to your local machine.
2. Unzip the repo content. 
3. In your chrome browser go to option > More tools > Extensions.
4. Select "Load Unpacked", and navigate to the unzipped repo folder > Select Folder.
5. Select the radio button to enable the extension. Done! 
```
#### When on the review page, the button will automatically appear.
    
## ATTENTION!

#### This is still an early release. More updates will be made.

- The button will only work with DFE student numbers. 
- Sometimes the link won't work, because of non-existing student numbers, multiple student folders, and different folder names.
- The button uses a hardcoded URL path name. 
- â€‹If you get an error, you'll have to find the student files manually.
